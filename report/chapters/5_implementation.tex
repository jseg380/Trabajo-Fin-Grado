\chapter{Implementation details}

This chapter transitions from the abstract design of Chapter 3 to the concrete technical implementation of the \textit{AlDiaCAR} system. It provides a detailed walkthrough of the project's source code, explaining the structure, key modules, and programming patterns used in both the backend and frontend.

\section{Project structure overview}

The project is organized as a monorepo, a single repository containing all the code for the system. This approach simplifies dependency management and streamlines development across the different parts of the application. The high-level directory structure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dirtree}.

The \texttt{src} directory cleanly separates the \texttt{backend} and \texttt{frontend} concerns. The \texttt{docker} directory ensures a reproducible development environment, while the \texttt{tests} directory houses the quality assurance framework.

\section{Backend implementation (Node.js)}

The backend is a RESTful API built with Node.js and the Express.js framework. It is responsible for all business logic, data persistence, and security.

\subsection{Data models (Mongoose)}
Data schemas are defined in \texttt{src/backend/models/} using Mongoose. The principal models are \texttt{User.js}, \texttt{Vehicle.js}, and \texttt{Trip.js}. A key feature is the use of Mongoose's \texttt{timestamps} option in the User schema to automatically manage \texttt{createdAt} and \texttt{updatedAt} fields. The password field uses \texttt{select: false} to prevent it from ever being sent in an API response. The full schema definitions are detailed in Appendix B.

\subsection{Controllers and business logic}
Controllers, located in \texttt{src/backend/controllers/}, contain the core logic for each API endpoint. While many controllers perform standard CRUD operations, some, like \texttt{tripController.js}, encapsulate more complex business logic. The \texttt{logSimulatedTrip} function demonstrates how a single API call can trigger multiple state changes across the system.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption={Core logic from \texttt{tripController.js}}]
// 1. UPDATE VEHICLE MAINTENANCE METRICS
if (vehicle.upcomingMaintenance) {
  if (vehicle.upcomingMaintenance.brakes?.distance) {
    vehicle.upcomingMaintenance.brakes.distance -= distance;
  }
  // ... other distance-based counters are reduced
}

// 2. CREATE THE TRIP RECORD
const calculatedEmissions = distance * (vehicle.emissions || 150);
await Trip.create({ driver: userId, vehicle: vehicleId, distance, ... });

// 3. UPDATE USER STATS & GRANT ACHIEVEMENTS
user.stats.distanceTraveled += distance;
const achievementsToGrant = [];
if (!user.achievements.includes('FIRST_TRIP')) {
  achievementsToGrant.push('FIRST_TRIP');
}
if (oldDistance < 1000 && user.stats.distanceTraveled >= 1000) {
  achievementsToGrant.push('DIST_1000');
}
if (achievementsToGrant.length > 0) {
  user.achievements.push(...achievementsToGrant);
}

// 4. SAVE ALL CHANGES ATOMICALLY
await Promise.all([vehicle.save(), user.save()]);
\end{lstlisting}

This function shows how logging a trip correctly decrements maintenance counters on the vehicle, creates a new trip record, and updates the user's statistics and achievements, all within a single transaction. Figure \ref{fig:data-flow-trip} illustrates this interaction.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
        node distance=2cm and 3.2cm, 
        font=\sffamily,
        proc/.style={
            rectangle, rounded corners, draw, dashed, fill=gray!10,
            text width=4cm, align=center, minimum height=1.5cm
        }
    ]
        \node (client) [comp, minimum width=2.5cm, text width=2.3cm] {Frontend Client};
        \node (backend) [comp, right=of client, text width=4cm] {Backend API \\ (\texttt{tripController.js})};
        \node (db) [db, right=of backend] {MongoDB};

        \draw[arrow, bend left=30] (client.east) to node[midway, above, sloped] {\texttt{POST /api/trips/log}} (backend.west);
        \draw[arrow, bend left=30] (backend.west) to node[midway, below, sloped] {201 Created} (client.east);
        
        \draw[arrow, bend left=30] (backend.east) to node[midway, above, sloped] {Find User, Vehicle} (db.west);
        \draw[arrow, bend left=30] (db.west) to node[midway, below, sloped] {Return documents} (backend.east);
        
        \node[proc, below=of backend, node distance=2cm] (logic) {Update stats \& achievements. \\ Decrement maintenance km.};
        \draw[arrow] (backend) -- (logic);
        
        \draw[arrow, bend right=40] (logic.south) to node[midway, below, sloped] {Save User, Vehicle, Trip} (db.south);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Sequence diagram for the trip logging data flow.}
    \label{fig:data-flow-trip}
\end{figure}

\subsection{API routes and middleware}
Routes defined in \texttt{src/backend/routes/} map the API endpoints to controller functions. The most critical middleware, \texttt{authMiddleware.js}, protects these routes. It extracts the JWT from an \texttt{HttpOnly} cookie, verifies it, and attaches the user's ID to the request object. This makes the user's identity available to any protected controller.

\section{Frontend implementation (React Native)}

The frontend is a cross-platform mobile application developed using React Native with the Expo framework and TypeScript for static typing.

\subsection{Navigation and screen structure}
The application uses Expo's file-based router. Directories and files within \texttt{src/frontend/app/} automatically become routes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Layouts (`\_layout.tsx`):} These files define the shell UI, such as the main tab bar defined in \texttt{app/(tabs)/\_layout.tsx}.
    \item \textbf{Authentication flow (`app/(auth)`):} A route group for the login and register screens, active when a user is not authenticated.
    \item \textbf{Main screens (`app/(tabs)`):} Represent the core features. A key pattern used is \texttt{useFocusEffect} from Expo Router to re-fetch data whenever a screen comes into view, ensuring data is always fresh after an update (e.g., after adding a new vehicle).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State management and API communication}
Global state for user authentication is managed via React's Context API in \texttt{context/AuthContext.tsx}. This provider stores the user's authentication status and profile information. Communication with the backend is handled using the \texttt{axios} library, which is configured with \texttt{withCredentials: true} to automatically handle the sending and receiving of authentication cookies.

\section{Integration and deployment}

\subsection{Local development with Docker}
To ensure a consistent development environment, the project utilizes Docker and Docker Compose. The \texttt{docker/docker-compose.yaml} file defines all services required to run the application stack locally, including the backend, frontend, database, and the Mongo Express GUI. A developer can start the entire stack with a single command: \texttt{docker-compose up}.

\subsection{Deployment strategy}
While the current focus is a robust prototype, a potential production deployment strategy would involve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Backend:} Containerizing the Node.js application and deploying it to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Heroku or a container orchestrator.
    \item \textbf{Database:} Using a managed database service like MongoDB Atlas.
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} Building the mobile application for production using Expo Application Services (EAS) and submitting the binaries to the app stores.
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing strategy and implementation}
The \texttt{tests/} directory houses a multi-layered testing strategy. For full details on the specific test cases, see Appendix D.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Backend unit \& Integration tests:} The \texttt{tests/backend/} directory uses Jest to test modules in isolation and Supertest to test API endpoint integration.
    \item \textbf{Frontend E2E tests:} The \texttt{tests/frontend/} directory is configured for Playwright, which runs automated tests that simulate key user journeys in a real browser environment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Security and privacy considerations}
Security is implemented through several mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Password hashing:} The \texttt{bcryptjs} library is used to securely hash and salt user passwords.
    \item \textbf{Authentication:} JWTs are stored in secure, \texttt{HttpOnly} cookies, which helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    \item \textbf{Route protection:} The \texttt{authMiddleware} ensures that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.
    \item \textbf{Environment variables:} Sensitive information like database connection strings and JWT secrets are managed via \texttt{.env} files and are not committed to version control.
\end{itemize}



\section{Development effort and cost analysis}

While this project was undertaken within an academic context, it is valuable to perform a cost analysis to estimate the resources required to develop a market-ready product based on the AlDiaCAR concept. This section provides a high-level budget estimation, breaking down the costs associated with the development of the "Thesis-Grade Beta" (the scope implemented for this project) and projecting the additional investment needed to achieve the full Zenith release.

\subsection{Methodology and assumptions}

The budget is calculated based on a team of freelance professionals based in Spain, with standard market rates for software development roles. The estimation is based on the hours required for each key phase of the project: design, development, and project management.

The following roles and hourly rates are assumed:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Project manager / Product owner:} Responsible for requirements, planning, and oversight. Rate: €50/hour.
\item \textbf{UI/UX Designer:} Responsible for visual identity, wireframing, and creating high-fidelity mockups. Rate: €35/hour.
\item \textbf{Backend developer:} Responsible for the server, API, and database architecture. Rate: €40/hour.
\item \textbf{Frontend (Mobile) developer:} Responsible for the React Native application. Rate: €40/hour.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Estimated development costs}

Table \ref{tab:development_costs} outlines the estimated hours and costs for the development of the Thesis-Grade Beta (representing the completed Alpha and Beta phases) and the projected additional effort required to complete the Zenith release.

\hline
\multicolumn{5}{r}{\textbf{Projected total for Zenith release:}} & \textbf{€25,050} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The development of the Thesis-Grade Beta, which includes the critical household data model, the reservation system, and the full multi-factor recommendation engine, is estimated to require approximately 310 person-hours, resulting in a cost of €12,650.

\textgap

To complete the Zenith release, which would involve integrating live third-party APIs, building the full graphical analytics dashboard, and implementing the collaborative gamification layer, an additional 300 person-hours are projected. This would represent a further investment of €12,400, bringing the total estimated development cost for a market-ready Zenith version to €25,050.
