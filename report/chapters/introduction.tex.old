\section{Context and relevance: global emissions and personal vehicle management}

The escalating climate crisis represents one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century, demanding urgent and innovative solutions across all sectors of society. Transportation stands out as a critical area for intervention. According to comprehensive data analysis, the transport sector was responsible for approximately 16.2\% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2016. Within this figure, road transport—comprising cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks—was the largest contributor, accounting for 11.9\% of total global emissions. A striking 60\% of these road transport emissions originate from passenger travel alone, primarily from the use of private vehicles \cite{owid-ghg-emissions-by-sector}.

This reliance on private cars is particularly pronounced in developed nations. In the European Union, for instance, the number of passenger cars per thousand inhabitants reached 560 in 2022, signaling a persistent trend towards private vehicle ownership \cite{passengers-cars-per-thousand-people}. 

This thesis argues that this fragmented, privately-managed household fleet represents a unique and critically underserved technological niche.

This thesis addresses these inefficiencies by focusing on holistic sustainability in private vehicle use. The concept extends beyond simply owning an electric vehicle; it encompasses diligent maintenance to ensure peak operational efficiency, as poorly maintained vehicles can see a significant increase in fuel consumption and pollutant emissions \cite{iea2021fuel}. It also involves conscious vehicle selection for each journey and the adoption of eco-driving habits.

Furthermore, this project is grounded in the principles of Green Computing, specifically "ICT for Sustainability." This pillar of Green IT focuses on applying software to influence and improve real-world processes. By developing intelligent software solutions, we can empower users to make more informed, environmentally conscious decisions. This project posits that a well-designed mobile application can serve as a persuasive technology, a concept defined as technology intentionally designed to change a person's attitudes or behaviors \cite{fogg2002persuasive}, thereby nudging users towards sustainable mobility patterns.

\section{The problem statement: the management gap for the modern vehicle owner}

\subsection{User persona: The Martínez household}

To illustrate the specific, real-world challenges this thesis addresses, we introduce the Martínez family—a representative modern household of four. The family consists of two parents and their two adult children living at home. One parent is a self-employed professional (\gls{autonomo}) with a variable schedule, another has a traditional 9-5 office job, one child works remotely, and the other is a university student.

Economically and environmentally conscious, the family manages a shared pool of three vehicles, deeming a fourth car an unnecessary expense. This shared 'household fleet' is diverse and reflects common vehicle ownership patterns in Spain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Vehicle 1: The City Runner. A 2014 diesel-powered hatchback. It is small, fuel-efficient, and easy to park, but possesses a \gls{distintivo-ambiental} B, legally restricting its access to \gls{low-emissions-zones} (Zonas de Bajas Emisiones - ZBE) in major city centers.
    \item Vehicle 2: The All-Rounder. A 2017 gasoline sedan with a Distintivo 'C'. It offers a balance of comfort and acceptable efficiency, with full access to many ZBEs.
    \item Vehicle 3: The Workhorse. A 2021 diesel SUV, also with a Distintivo 'C'. It is used for long family trips, transporting large items, and is the most comfortable, but also has the highest emissions and running costs.
\end{itemize}

The family's unpredictable, overlapping schedules combined with this diverse set of vehicles creates a complex, daily coordination problem that goes far beyond simple vehicle maintenance.

\subsection{A day in the Martínez's household: The cascading inefficiencies}

Consider a typical Wednesday morning. The \textit{autónomo} parent needs to visit a client in the city center's ZBE, making the 'B' car unusable. Simultaneously, the university student needs to get to campus and naturally prefers the small, efficient 'B' car. The 9-5 parent has already left with the 'C' sedan, the 'All-Rounder'.

This scenario triggers a series of questions that currently can only be answered through manual communication and physical checks: Is the SUV's key available? Is its ITV inspection due next week, making a long trip ill-advised?

Lacking a centralized source of truth, the parent takes the high-emission SUV for a short urban trip—a suboptimal choice forced by a coordination failure. This single event highlights the core pain points.

\subsection{Core pain points}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Coordination friction: The constant need for texts, calls, and trips to the garage to check vehicle availability and key status, wasting time and causing daily friction.

    \item Shared maintenance blindness: No single person has a complete, real-time overview of the maintenance status (ITV, oil changes, tire wear) across all three vehicles, leading to dangerous oversights.

    \item Inefficient, constraint-unaware selection: Vehicle choices are made based on immediate availability, not on a holistic view of ZBE restrictions, fuel costs, emissions, or upcoming maintenance needs.

    \item Lack of shared visibility: The family cannot collectively track their total transportation costs or environmental impact, preventing them from making informed group decisions to improve their habits.
\end{itemize}
